- Arrays in JavaScript <b>(allAboutArray.js)</b>
    - How to see the output of an array in JavaScript.
    - We can find the 'Length' of an array in JavaScript; it means, we can see in the output how many elements an array carries.
    - Finding an element of an array by its 'Index (Position) Number'.
    - In JavaScript, If we want to find an element from an array whose element does not exist in that array, what will happen? ==> It will result in 'undefined' in the output.
    - Setting a new value of an element of an array by using Index Number.
    - Suppose, we have two different arrays. We can re-assign the value of the elements of the first array (oldNumbers) by the value of the elements of the second array (newNumbers). We have to use the Index Number in this case.
    - Using the Index Number, we can add a new element of an array in any position (not only in the first or in the last).
    - Exceptional case :: Empty Index Position :: Will result 'undefined'.
    - Finding the Index (position) Number of an array in JavaScript by using the 'indexOf()' method. It will result in '-1' if the asking array element does not exist inside of an array.
    - Array push() Method <b>(arrayPushPop.js)</b>
        - Adding a new element to the last of an array using the 'Array push() Method'.
        - We can also add more than one element to the last of an array using the 'Array push() Method'.
    - Array pop() Method <b>(arrayPushPop.js)</b>
        - Removing an element from the last of an array using the 'Array pop() Method'.
        - The 'Array pop() Method' returns us the removed element from the array, which we can use later anywhere by storing it inside a variable.
    - Array unshift() Method <b>(arrayUnshiftShift.js)</b>
        - Adding a new element to the first of an array (numbers) using the 'Array unshift() Method'.
        - We can also add more than one new element to the first of an array using the 'Array unshift() Method'.
    - Array shift() Method <b>(arrayUnshiftShift.js)</b>
        - Removing an element from the first of an array using the 'Array shift() Method'.
        - The 'Array shift() Method' returns us the removed element from the array, which we can use later anywhere by storing it inside a variable
